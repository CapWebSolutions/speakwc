		Two factor authentication prevents an intruder from getting into your site even if they crack your username and password. 2FA will send a code to you rsmart phone which you will then enter into the challenge box to complete the login process. I use this on my maintnance management tool as an added preventative measure.<br>
		Authy & Google Authenticator are good tools to use on your smart phone for authentication<br>
		Limiting logins is going to lock your login page down too, by the nature of their functionality.
