	<h2>Things to Look For</h2>
	<h4>&mdash;Security Plugins&mdash;</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Ban Admin & sitename attemtps</li>
		<li>Set Login Limits</li>
		<li>404 Detection</li>
		<li>Email Notifications</li>
	</ul>
	<aside class="notes">
		If someone tries to log into your site with admin, knock them offline right away. You do not have those users?
		Limiting login attempts prevents brute force attacks at password guessing. 
		If a bot is scanning for vulnerabilites on your site - out of date plugins/theme - they will get a high number of 404 errors. This is unusual. Block it immediately. 
		Get notified when things are happening.

Here are a number of plugins I like for website security. The top are free, but have premium versions available.  The options can be daunting at first but start with the recommended options and then tweak them to meet your needs.
