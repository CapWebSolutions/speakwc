	<h2>Things to Look For</h2>
	<h4>&mdash;Backup Plugins&mdash;</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Automatic Backups</li>
		<li>Multiple Destinations</li>
		<li>Various Backup Types - full, db, media </li>
		<li>Restoration</li>
		<li>Email Notifications on Failure</li>
	</ul>
	<aside class="notes">
		Set it once and forget about it. 
		Don't save your backup on your web host. If your host goes down, there goes your backup. Set up a free DropBox account. Amazon S3 is VERY inexpensive.
		Take db backups frequently, full backups less, media only on occasion - depending on site activity. 
		Need to be able to easily restore what has been backed up.
		Get notified when things are going south.

Here are a number of plugins I like for website backup. They offer multiple destinations options for your backup. There are many more options available.
