		Before we get much further, please allow me to offer a little background on myself. Couple of degrees in computer science from back in the dark ages, aka pre-www days. Lots of programming in a bunch of different languages, morphed into management positions in networking, network infrastructure and most recently back into software development as the channel manager for a small software company in maryland. In the last 5 years I've gotten back into programming, now using WordPress, and have found my joie de vivre. I have a one person WP dev and maintenance company and love what I do.
