		Basic security - We are going to address low hanging fruit<br>
		While this doesn't stop the determined hacker, it does deter many. <br>
		You hear it everywhere - keep your website updated. This means WordPress core, all your plugins - activated <strong>and</strong> deactivated, and all your installed themes. <br>If file is found on your website and has a vulnerability, it may still be able to be compromised. <br>
		Backups. You are going it need it. Not IF, but WHEN.

		Automated hacks are what is going on. There's no one person sitting at a computer trying dozens of passwords. Bots do this at hundreds of attempts per min.
		Don't use admin username - easy target for password guessing. Ditto for your website name as a username.<br>
		Creating a new user or changing you password, WordPress will recommend a strong one. Use it. Consider pass phrase. <br> 
		Don't use user #1. The first username created on your website. Think of it as a throw-away. Create real user at #2. Small interruption for user enumerators. <br>Remember, we are talking low-hanging fruit here. Will not stop everything but does slow down casual hacker.

Understand what is meant by Core? The files that make up the base WordPress software. Updated 3 - 4 times per year<br>
Plugins - both activated and non-activated. They are on your website. Keep them updated. Delete unnecessary plugins. Plugin not being maintained. Find another. Vulnerable files in these deactivated plugins are still accessible from the interwebs.<br>
Remove unused themes. Recommend keeping your active theme and the current WordPress default theme - ie twenty-seventeen, twenty-sixteen.<br> 
User cleaning? Get rid of any users no longer active on your website. Keep number of admins at a minimum. User role minimalization. 
Reliable backups - regular. What is regular? How often does your website change? Once a day? Once a week? Hourly? Set database to backup based on change frequency and files one period less. Depends heavily on usage.
